# Sally Stash Game

For this project I created the different versions of a children’s game
designed to encourage logic, strategy, and critical thinking as well as teach
them the difference between rows and columns. The game, Sally’s Stash, has
two players hiding different colored stacks of gold for the squirrel and then
each tries to find the stacks the other has hidden. Interestingly, it is believed
that real tree squirrels hide their nuts by size, type, nutritional value and taste
using a spatial chunking technique so they can find them later.
